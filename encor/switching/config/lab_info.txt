There are too many variables to create an accurate set of configuration documents,
so there won't be any config files. The basic premise of this lab is:

1. Multi-switch environment
2. Proper implementation of inter-VLAN routing, RPVST+, and EtherChannel (LACP)
3. Mixture of Cisco-proprietary (RPVST+) and industry-standard (LACP) protocols
4. Redundant uplink switches to router
5. One uplink switch is STP root for half the VLANs, other uplink is STP root for the rest (opposite secondaries)
6. Port security on access links
    -Max 2
    -Current device MAC hardcoded
    -Shutdown on violation
7. PortFast and BPDUGuard on access links
8. Boilerplate configured on all

VLANs in the environment:
10 - IT
20 - HR
30 - Sales
40 - Customer Service
50 - Accounting
80 - Native
99 - Management
100 - Blackhole
